
Immediate to-do

-Make the level up event and button right now.

	- Make the gear level up UI pop up
		-The button that will level up the piece of gear
			-which menas probably dequip and requip at new level to apply stat boosts
		- the button to clear out of the menu
		- level up should then just work

-Finish the UI elements
	- Crafting slots that work - a list that triggers a craft probably
	- Player Stats
	- stackable items
- Fix the  equip script what ever is going on there
- add some level up content
- redo the gem actions to actually match what we're doing
- make monsters drop shit probably
- for now a shop will probably be a pop up mans, but later its replacing the gem table

	

long term todo
- add what the bad does - potentially nothing until added.
- different enemies have different abilities
- work on the animations for the -- Should be easy enough to do, most of its done its just hooking it in 
	-player, 
	-enemy
- UI elements. 
- combos
- experience and leveling up for gear
- enemy variation (perhaps an enemy that might heal?)


later later ideas
- shields as equipment - offensive shields.
- while you have shields potentially heal. 
- elemental combos when an ement has a element hit it for x seconds another element combos somehow



thoughts on gear: What a playable level looks like?
Currently im not sure how two things should occur: Sources of gear
and sources of gear progression.

How to get gear is kinda weird, like having it drop from mobs? Having it be sold by the shop? How often are shops?
Do you split it, being able to craft really good gear, gear drops from mobs and you can snipe purchase from shops?

If you can do lal tehse things then how do duplicates and your inventory work? Combining gear to increase rarity?
What does the progression of combining for rarity do for the items themselveS?

Weapons and their kinda lack of multitudes right now? --  Potentially add range to increase weapon potential types?

Normal gear progression -- you pool experience and then target what gear you wish to upgrade?

increased tick rate as a buff. 

crafting is queued -- to make a potion is like 15 seconds - uses monster drops. 
pausing completely covers the board

potentially split potions and elixirs

shop is where you can get gear
boss's/mini bosses
normal mobs drop gear. 


test push
