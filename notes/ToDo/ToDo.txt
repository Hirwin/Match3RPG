
Immediate to-do
- make the shop actually sell things?
- add base level progression and an equipable item
- make an hp potion that you can buy.
- make the spell level up? 
- brain storm how spell progression works. 
- a spell that effects the board

long term todo
- bug enemy doesn't spawn
- add what the bad does - potentially nothing until added.
- different enemies have different abilities
- work on the animations for the -- Should be easy enough to do, most of its done its just hooking it in 
	-player, 
	-enemy
- UI elements. 
- add the charge action for the magic attack -- though this may change depending on austin
- combos
- experience and leveling up
- enemy variation (perhaps an enemy that might heal?)


later later ideas
- shields as equipment - offensive shields.
- while you have shields potentially heal. 
- Potentially make some of the gems match add ot a meta spell crafting skill
