
Immediate to-do	
	Make enemies drop experience and potentially equippable gear?
		-probably involves declaring drop pools in the enemy spawner but like..blegh that sounds hard, lets think on how 
		to approach this



-Finish the UI elements
	- Crafting slots that work - a list that triggers a craft probably
	- stackable items
	- display shield over healthbar somehow
- add some level up content
- for now a shop will probably be a pop up mans, but later its replacing the gem table

	

long term todo
- maybe random buffs on equipment?
- add what the bad does - potentially nothing until added.
- combos
- Hover stats for items probably actually...(This should be able to be added for in the onHover invoke with that one thing I got)
-hidden stats till y ou discover it
-charging at certain levels will be what you have to do to perform certain skills that you unlock for the weapons or amulets or 
maybe even like shield ups and shit, endless posibilities


later later ideas
- shields as equipment - offensive shields.
- while you have shields potentially heal. 
- elemental combos when an ement has a element hit it for x seconds another element combos somehow
- multiple party members each unique gem board?



thoughts on gear: What a playable level looks like?
Currently im not sure how two things should occur: Sources of gear
and sources of gear progression.

How to get gear is kinda weird, like having it drop from mobs? Having it be sold by the shop? How often are shops?
Do you split it, being able to craft really good gear, gear drops from mobs and you can snipe purchase from shops?

If you can do lal tehse things then how do duplicates and your inventory work? Combining gear to increase rarity?
What does the progression of combining for rarity do for the items themselveS?

Weapons and their kinda lack of multitudes right now? --  Potentially add range to increase weapon potential types?

Normal gear progression -- you pool experience and then target what gear you wish to upgrade?

increased tick rate as a buff. 

crafting is queued -- to make a potion is like 15 seconds - uses monster drops. 
pausing completely covers the board

potentially split potions and elixirs

shop is where you can get gear
boss's/mini bosses
normal mobs drop gear.
